# My Interface Platform
This is my Interface platform. I use this as a template for many projects. This allows me to easily create GUIs for projects I make. Now I wish to make this open source, allowing everyone to use it. 

### About this
This GUI is made from pygame and is written in python. It only works full-screen, but is very user-friendly.

### Issues
As I said before this does not work as a minimized window. I am working on changes for this right now.
